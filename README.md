# Credit Scoring Classification Project

This project applies machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to predict credit risk based on customer data. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, class imbalance handling with SMOTE, and model evaluation using various performance metrics.

## Features:
- Handles missing values
- Applies SMOTE for balanced classification
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Visualizes ROC curves and F1-score comparisons

## Libraries Used:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
